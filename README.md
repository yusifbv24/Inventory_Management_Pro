# Inventory Management System

A microservices-based inventory management system built with .NET 8 for tracking products, managing transfers between departments, and handling approval workflows.

## Features

- **Product Management** - Add, edit, delete products with images and track their status
- **Inventory Transfers** - Move products between departments with full history tracking
- **Approval Workflow** - Request and approve changes for controlled environments
- **Real-time Notifications** - Get instant updates via SignalR and WhatsApp integration
- **Role-based Access** - Admin, Manager, and User roles with fine-grained permissions
- **Department & Category Management** - Organize products by location and type
- **Search & Filtering** - Find products quickly with Azerbaijani language support
- **Export Options** - Generate PDF and Word reports

## Architecture

The system uses a microservices architecture:

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| API Gateway | Routes requests using Ocelot |
| Identity Service | Handles authentication and user management |
| Product Service | Manages products, categories, and departments |
| Route Service | Tracks inventory movements and transfers |
| Approval Service | Manages approval requests and workflows |
| Notification Service | Real-time notifications via SignalR |
| Web Application | User interface |

## Tech Stack

- **PostgreSQL** - Database
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for service communication
- **SignalR** - Real-time notifications
- **Entity Framework Core** - ORM
- **MediatR** - CQRS pattern implementation
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Nginx** - Reverse proxy with SSL
- **Serilog + Seq** - Centralized logging
- **JWT** - Authentication

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- .NET 8 SDK (for local development)

### Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inventory-management.git
cd inventory-management
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```env
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
RABBITMQ_USER=guest
RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=guest
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_ISSUER=your_issuer
JWT_AUDIENCE=your_audience
SEQ_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin123!
```

3. Start the services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the application at `https://localhost`

### Local Development

Each service can be run individually:

```bash
cd src/ProductService.API
dotnet run
```

Development ports:
- Web App: 5051
- API Gateway: 5000
- Product Service: 5001
- Route Service: 5002
- Identity Service: 5003
- Approval Service: 5004
- Notification Service: 5005
- Seq Dashboard: 5342
